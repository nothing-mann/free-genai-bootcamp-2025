The usage of XML while not necessary is welcome for complex prompting.


### Response Quality (GOOD)
* The results were concise and to the point for the English sentence. 
* The result for initial breakdown of English sentence was better than Gemini.
* During the translation, it struggled with Romaji.
* It was able to work well with Kanji and Hiragana.
* It could not follow complex commands like adding Kanji and Furigana in the same column separated by braces for vocabulary table so Kanji and Furigana were placed in separate columns.
* It sometimes kept repeating same clues so that had to be explicitly prohibited.
* Le Chat provides to the point clues with no verbose answers so it is preferrable in that regard.
