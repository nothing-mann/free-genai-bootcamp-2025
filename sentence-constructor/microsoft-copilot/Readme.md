The usage of XML while not necessary is welcome for complex prompting. If you need to handle hierarchical data with a lot of metadata, XML might be a better choice. However, if you prefer simplicity and need better performance in web environments, JSON might be more suitable.

* The think deeper mode was very powerful and provided very natural and concise responses.
* It was very consistent and provided great support while staying in the role.
